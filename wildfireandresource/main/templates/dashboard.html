        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our application simplifies the process of managing critical incident forms through intelligent data extraction and generation.</p>

        <h3 class="text-primary">1. Agreement Contract Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Upload an Existing PDF:</strong> Upload your agreement contract PDF file. The system will prompt you to provide an associated short description. Once uploaded, The application intelligently mines crucial information, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Contract Number</li>
                    <li>Issuer Contact Information</li>
                    <li>Amount</li>
                    <li>Important Dates</li>
                    <li>Vendor Information</li>
                    <li>Associated Resources</li>
                </ul>
                This data is then securely stored and readily accessible for further operations.
            </li>
            
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-primary">2. Resource Order (RO) Form Management</h3>
        <p>You can manage Resource Order forms in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Upload an Existing PDF:</strong> Upload your Resource Order PDF file. The system will prompt you to select an associated agreement contract. Once uploaded, our intelligent parser will automatically mine the following critical data points directly from the PDF:
                <ul>
                    <li>Project Name</li>
                    <li>Incident Number</li>
                    <li>Resource Model and Make</li>
                    <li>Request Number</li>
                    <li>Resource Assigned</li>
                </ul>
                The form is then securely stored for future reference.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Manual Data Entry:</strong> Alternatively, if you don't have a PDF to upload, you can manually input the above-mentioned information directly into the system using provided input fields. This flexibility ensures you can generate necessary documentation quickly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-primary">3. Generating Essential Forms</h3>
        <p>The mined or manually entered data from the Resource Order Form is then used to populate two vital documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Emergency Shift Ticket:</strong> This form utilizes all the information retrieved from the Resource Order Form. Additionally, the system provides extra input fields where you can add more specific details required for the Emergency Shift Ticket.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Evaluation Form:</strong> The Evaluation form is designed for simplicity. It exclusively uses the information mined (or manually entered) from the Resource Order Form, requiring no additional user input for its generation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This automated process ensures consistency and reduces errors across your incident documentation.</p>
